<p>In a practical CFD simulation, a thickness of turublent premixed flame is much smaller than the resolution of computational grid.
This means the flame cannot be resolved in the simulation. 
Obviously, using more refined mesh could be a solution and Adaptive Mesh Refinement could be use to resolve the flame.
Another approach to solve this problem is the thickened flame model which automatically detecting flame region and artificially increase thickness of the flame.
After the flame is thickened, the thickened flame can be resolved in the computational grid and account for a large scale interaction between flow and flame.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The flame thickness can be increase by increase diffusivity($D$) of the species.
\begin{equation
\delta \propto \sqrt{D/S_{L}}
\end{equation}</li>
</ol>

<p>Hovever, merely thickening flame changes flame dynamics, since the flame speed depends on the flame thickness($\delta$) and reaction rate ($\dot{\omega}$).</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
S_{L} \propto \sqrt{D\dot{\omega}} \label{2}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>To preserve the flame speed, we increase the diffusivity and decrease reaction rate.</p>
